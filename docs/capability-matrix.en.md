# Capability Matrix

Use this matrix to keep CLI, skills, and MCP integrations aligned across different agent entry points.

The default low-risk `assisted` mode remains local, read-only first, and user-triggered; restricted capabilities return `COMPLIANCE_BLOCKED`. Explicitly run `boss config set operating_mode research` to enable capabilities declared for Research Mode. Research runs must remain bounded, redacted, checkpointed, and stoppable; use `boss schema` and `compliance.capabilities` as the source of truth.

## Auth and environment

| Capability | CLI command | Login required | Transport |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protocol discovery | `boss schema` | No | Local |
| Log in | `boss login` | No | User-triggered login |
| Log out | `boss logout` | No | Local |
| Session status | `boss status` | Yes | httpx |

| Config management | `boss config` | No | Local |
| Cache cleanup | `boss clean` | No | Local |
| Restricted research crawl | `boss crawl run/start/resume`, plus `configure/status/results/stop` | Yes | Isolated DrissionPage profile; MCP remains assisted-only and can only read or import an existing run |

## Job discovery

| Personalized recommendations | `boss recommend` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Job detail | `boss detail` | Yes | httpx first, browser fallback |
| Show by index | `boss show` | No | Local cache |

| Shortlist management | `boss favorites` | No | Platform read-only + Local |

## User profile

## Resume management

| Capability | CLI command | Login required | Transport |

## AI capabilities

| Chat coaching | `boss ai chat-coach` | No | AI service |

## Data insights

| Capability | CLI command | Login required | Transport |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application funnel stats | `boss stats` | No | Local |

## Recruiter workflow

| Capability | CLI command | Login required | Transport |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application inbox | `boss hr applications` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Candidate search | `boss hr candidates` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Recruiter chat list | `boss hr chat` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Chat message history | `boss hr chatmsg <friend_id>` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Recent-message summaries | `boss hr last-messages [--friend-id <id>]` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Online resume view | `boss hr resume <geek_id> --selector <csel_...> --security-id <id>` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Contact exchange | `boss hr resume --exchange --friend-id <friend_id> [--type wechat]` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Reply to candidate | `boss hr reply <friend_id> <message>` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Request attached resume | `boss hr request-resume <friend_id>` | Yes | Restricted (blocked by default) |
| Job listing and online/offline operations | `boss hr jobs` | Yes | httpx |
| Recruiter AI workspace | `boss hr ai` | Depends on subcommand | Local + AI service; platform-reading subcommands such as `evaluate-geek` / `screen-applications` remain subject to authorization and operating-mode boundaries |

`boss hr ai` covers job/rubric configuration, single and batch resume evaluation, guarded BOSS candidate evaluation, application screening, ranking, reports, human stage updates, and reply drafts. It does not automatically hire, reject, or send messages.

Notes:
- **Transport**: `httpx` means a direct API call. Assisted Mode stops on risk-control blocks. Research Mode may run explicitly declared browser/hook adapters, but not unbounded retries, and must preserve checkpoints and redaction. `AI service` means a third-party model API; do not send chat records, resumes, or contact details without authorization.
- For CLI-first integrations, prefer `boss schema` for capability discovery and parameter validation; the schema exposes both `supported_platforms` and `supported_recruiter_platforms`.
- Current platform coverage: `zhipin` has both candidate and recruiter implementations, but sensitive workflows are blocked by default; `zhilian` supports candidate-side workflows and recruiter automation through the `agent` browser/CDP adapter V1; `qiancheng` / 51job is a registered placeholder adapter whose real workflows return `NOT_SUPPORTED`.
- Current auth posture: `zhipin` and `zhilian` keep user-triggered login compatibility; risk-control research belongs only in explicit Research Mode adapters and must not bypass platform risk controls.
- `crawl` is a user-triggered sequential Research Mode task using an isolated Chrome profile, cross-process rate budget, SQLite checkpoints, and the `crawl stop` kill switch; MCP remains assisted-only and exposes only local `crawl_status/results/shortlist` operations for an existing run. The default Hook is `none`; users may select a Hook only when they have authorization to provide the original local files and `SHA256SUMS`. Candidate `agent crawl` consumes only completed runs by default; a new crawl requires `operating_mode=research` and `--allow-crawl`. Risk codes, a security page, or an exhausted budget stop it and return a resume command.
- Use `boss schema` as the source of truth: it currently exposes 38 top-level commands. The upstream capability-matrix baseline records 9 first-level recruiter subcommands under `hr`; this fork adds `hr ai` as the 10th recruiter AI workspace entry. `ai` and `resume` remain command-group entries.
